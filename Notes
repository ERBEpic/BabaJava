I need to write down documentation for GraphicsController because this is a mess

FileFinder accepts 4 inputs. One it grabs on its own

It combines everything into one final string, the path.
It combines First, Second, And third. (first_second_third.png)
One, id. Very simple. What the object is. No issues here.
This is directly "First".
Three, counter. *EVERYTHING* rotates on a 3 frame basis (Thank god.) Very simple.


Second, is a mess. Its a combination of rotation and walking.

Some objects rotate but dont walk. (Arrow).
Some objects walk but dont rotate. (Bat)
Some objects have a walk cycle of 4 (Arrow)
BABA IS NOT A CYCLE OF 5. BABA_7, 15, and 23 are FAKE.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
