THIS WAS MADE FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT. I do not claim to own any of the sprites used in this project, and I do not wish to infringe on any copyright of the original owner. If this repository needs to be taken down, or the sprites need to be taken off, let me know.

This repository has three branches, main, multiClient and multiplayer. Main is the original project, multiclient and multiplayer are a client and host respectively of the main project re-implemented for a second school project, where each multiclient can control the host. Its very gimmecky.

Below is documentation which I wrote to explain the code, it is very rough and mostly for self reference.


Documentation
This is a java recreation of a game Baba Is You. I am only recreating the first world.
Below is documentation about my implementation of code.


Memorycontroller stores stuff like this
[0]=id
[1]=rotation - 0 = Right, 1=up, 2=left, 3=down, 4=Unrotatable right, 5=unrotatable up, 6=unrotatable left, 7=unrotatable down
[2]=walkingcycle, 0-1-2-3
[3]=hasbeenmovedbyyou (Not to be changed manually)
[4]=hasbeenmoved(not to be changed manually, also unused as move is unused)
